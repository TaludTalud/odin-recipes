        <h3>Discription</h3>
        <p><strong>Egg in a Hole</strong> is a delicious runny yolk egg cooked in the center of piece of toast and eaten with a fork</p>
        <p>It is a great way to enjoy an egg in a slightly different way.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons bacon grease</li>
            <li> 1 slice bread</li>
            <li> 1 egg</li>
            <li> salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt the bacon grease in a non-stick pan over low heat.</li>
            <li>Cut a 1 1/2 to 2-inch hole from the center of the bread slice; lay in the hot skillet. When the side facing down is lightly toasted, about 2 minutes, flip and crack the egg into the hole; season with salt and pepper. Continue to cook until the egg is cooked and mostly firm. Flip again and cook 1 minute more to assure doneness on both sides. Serve immediately.</li>
