        <h3>Discription</h3>
        <p>A<strong>chocolate chip cookie</strong> is a drop cookie that features chocolate chips or chocolate morsels as its istinguishing ingredient.
        Chocolate chip cookies originated in the United States around 1938 when Ruth Graves Wakefield chopped up a Nestle semi-sweet chocolate bar
        and added the chopped chocolate to a cookie recipe.</p>
        <p>Generally, the recipe starts with a dough composed of flour, butter, both brown and white sugar, semi-sweet chocolate chips,
             eggs, and vanilla. Variations on the recipe may add other types of chocolate, as well as additional ingredients such as nuts or oatmeal.
             There are also vegan verions with the necessary ingredients substitutions, such as vegan chocolate chips, vegan margarine, and egg substitutes.
             A <em> chocolate chocolate chip cookie</em> uses a dough flavored with chocolate or cocoa powder, before chocolate chips aer mixed in.
              These variations of the recipe are also reffered to as double or triple chocolate chip cookies, depending on the combination of dough and chocolate types.
